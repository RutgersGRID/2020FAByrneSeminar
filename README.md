**Seminar Description**

Cities face challenges when it comes to messaging about available social services, historical curiosities, and creative culture. Community access isn't necessarily limited by financial or bureaucratic barriers, but through wayfinding and navigation due to poor signage or a dearth of public information. Through web-based tools in XR (extended reality, inclusive of augmented and virtual reality), our smartphones can give us the ability to immediately reveal resources hidden in plain sight as well as provide on-the-fly context and insight for both our built and natural environments. XR integrates real-world experience with virtual world access. When produced as a robust community-based ecosystem, XR adds another layer of texture to the places where we live and work and fundamentally changes the way we think about a traditional neighborhood. By using the mobile camera to frame and interact with the world, we're helping people frame and interpret what they are seeing. Through the use of game mechanics and incentives, we're enhancing and encouraging exploration and fighting isolation between individuals. Students will learn augmented reality 3D-modeling and game development in Unity (ubiquitous developer software), and learn about New Brunswick community development to marry their applied technical and creative skills with real world service access needs. Students will work in groups, responding to five different public art locations in the Esperanza Neighborhood of New Brunswick.

**Absence Policy**

Students are expected to attend all classes; if you expect to miss a class, please use the University absence reporting website <https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/> to indicate the date and reason for your absence. An email is automatically sent to me.

**Disability Services**

Rutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University's educational programs. In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: <https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines>. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus's disability services office will provide you with a Letter of Accommodations. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. To begin this process, please complete the registration form on the ODS web site at: <https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/registration-form>

**Academic Integrity**

Plagiarism is a major offense at Rutgers University. You are responsible for understanding the academic integrity policy and following these principles. Failure to uphold these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the University community therefore bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld. **The complete academic integrity policy can be found here:** [**http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/.**](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/.**)

**Class Locations**

Zoom Credentials will be shared via direct message with class participants.

**Late Submission Policy:**
---------------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all written assignments, group projects, etc., are due at the time and date listed in the syllabus. If you experience an unavoidable personal situation that prevents you from completing work on time, please inform the instructor prior to the date the work is due. Late work will result in points taken off, a lowering of the assignment grade, and/or an "F," depending on the assignment.

**Attendance and Participation Policy**
---------------------------------------

*What this is:* Your requirements for student attendance, participation, and etiquette, along with information about the university self-reporting site.

**Your attendance requirements should reflect the university policy on absences related to religious holidays.**Â  You may choose to duplicate the official text of this policy or summarize it:

*"*It is University policy (University Regulation on Attendance, Book 2, 2.47B, formerly 60.14f) to excuse without penalty students who are absent from class because of religious observance and to allow the make-up of work missed because of such absence. Examinations and special required out-of-class activities shall ordinarily not be scheduled on those days when religiously observant students refrain from participating in secular activities. Absences for reasons of religious obligation shall not be counted for purposes of reporting.Â  Students are advised to provide timely notification to instructors about necessary absences for religious observances and are responsible for making up the work or exams according to an agreed-upon schedule."

Whether a class is in a physical classroom or online, it is fair to have expectations about student attendance and participation throughout the semester.Â  Whether a physical class or online, if you are using a course website and have rules about acceptable behaviors in online discussions, or other guidelines, you should state them clearly.Â  For example, if you have rules about discussion etiquette or group communication, these should be stated explicitly.

**Please include this text in your syllabus:**

"Students are expected to attend all classes; if you expect to miss one or two classes or a period of time in an online class, please use the University absence reporting website -

<https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/> - to indicate the date and reason for your absence.Â  An email will automatically be sent to me from this system.Â  Note that if you must miss classes for longer than one week, you should contact a dean of students to help verify your circumstances."

**For a face-to-face course**, be sure to state your policy for absences and for make-up exams/labs/assignments.Â  The university preference is that grades not be affected directly by attendance records, but rather by class participation.Â  In general two excused absences per semester are acceptable in a course that meets twice per week.

**For a face-to-face course**, be sure to state explicitly any rules you have about cell phone or computer use during the class.

**Library Resources**
---------------------

*What this is:* It is worth including this information on your syllabus -- links to specific library resources and contact information for a librarian who can assist students:

Rutgers University Libraries offer numerous resources to assist students.Â  Librarians can help guide you through research and reference tools. A series of [LibGuides](http://libguides.rutgers.edu/) are available to get you started.Â  The librarian who specifically supports SC&I is [we can give you the specific individual for the coming year], who is based at the XXX Library, name@email.rutgers.edu, XXX-XXX-XXXX.

Here are some of the LibGuides you may find useful:

**Academic Integrity**
----------------------

*What this is:* A clear statement about the Rutgers policy on academic integrity and a clear statement about the importance you place on academic honesty.Â  Minimally you should use language such as this in your syllabus:

The consequences of scholastic dishonesty are very serious.Â  Please review Rutgers' [academic integrity policy](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/):

<http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/>

Multimedia presentations about academic integrity are also available:

<http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/douglass/sal/plagiarism/intro.html>

Academic integrity means, among other things:

o Â  Develop and write all of your own assignments.

o Â  Show in detail where the materials you use in your papers come from.Â  Create citations whether you are paraphrasing authors or quoting them directly.Â  Be sure always to show source and page number within the assignment and include a bibliography in the back.Â 

o Â  Do not look over at the exams of others or use electronic equipment such as cell phones or MP3 players during exams.

o Â  Do not fabricate information or citations in your work.

o Â  Do not facilitate academic dishonesty for another student by allowing your own work to be submitted by others.

If you are doubtful about any issue related to plagiarism or scholastic dishonesty, please discuss it with the instructor.Â 

**Students with Disabilities**
------------------------------

*What this is:* a statement that encourages students with documented disabilities to present their Letters of Accommodation at the beginning of the semester and a statement that encourages others who do not have documented disabilities but believe they need accommodations to speak with you and/or Assistant Dean Kevin Ewell.Â  You may wish to include some of this language in your syllabus:

(For undergraduates)Â  Students with documented disabilities who need accommodations in this class must do so through the [Rutgers Disabilities Services Office](http://disabilityservices.rutgers.edu/) (<http://disabilityservices.rutgers.edu/>).Â  You can also speak with a SC&I adviser about your disability by visiting the Office of Student Services in the SC&I Building, Room 214 or calling them at 848-932-7500 (dial 2 as your menu choice).
